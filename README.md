# Aphrograph

## TODO List

* Investigate weird label cropping when using day labels (??? in from section)
* set a maximum label width (GraphWidget#68)
* Prefer a more compact time when the "seconds" section isn't used
* Better type safety around the metrics browser
* Add ability to adjust the display time (with or without new graphite call?)
* Fix command line input (defaulting to 24h in main?)
