# Aphrograph

## TODO List

* Better type safety around the metrics browser
* Add ability to adjust the display time (with or without new graphite call?)
* Fix command line input (defaulting to 24h in main?)
* Investigate weird label cropping when using day labels (??? in from section)
* Figure out a better solution for the EventM/IO ugliness
