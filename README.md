# Aphrograph

## TODO List

* Perform graphite call asynchronously, produce a new event when complete
* Show a loading sign while gathering data
* Investigate weird label cropping when using day labels (??? in from section)
* Remove weird double 'updateGraph' in App (#108)
* set a maximum label width (GraphWidget#68)
* Prefer a more compact time when the "seconds" section isn't used
