# Aphrograph

## TODO List

* Add ability to adjust the display time (with or without new graphite call?)
  * time dialog
    * pressing t opens the time dialog
    * time dialog and metrics browser are mutually exclusive
    * pressing t again when open closes the dialog

  * relative times
  * exact times
  * toggle refresh (set refresh time)

* Fix command line input (defaulting to 24h in main?)
* Investigate weird label cropping when using day labels (??? in from section)
* Figure out a better solution for the EventM/IO ugliness
* No pending tests
* Slim down executable dependencies
* Remember where we were on metrics view
